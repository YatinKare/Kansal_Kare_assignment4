To run, please use the run.sh shell file we provided. There are 2 driver files, SortingDriver.java and SortingDriver2.java for the 2 respective experiments, so adjust the filename in run.sh depending on the experiment. If running the first experiment, put in "./run.sh (filename)". For example, to run the first experiment with the ordered input, you would adjust the last line in run.sh to have SortingDriver.java instead of SortingDriver2.java and then run "run.sh ordered.txt".
